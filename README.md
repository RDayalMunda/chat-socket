## 游늷 Notes

- All events are expected to be handled over a persistent WebSocket connection.
- Be sure to properly bind listeners (`onTyping`, `onMessage`, etc.) to ensure real-time updates in the chat interface.
- Payload properties like `groupId`, `senderId`, and `senderName` must be accurate and up-to-date for proper event propagation.
